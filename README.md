### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joe.

I work on applying machine learning in computational biology domain, mostly in metabolomics and multi-omics data analysis.

All my work are available on this GitHub. I am actively publishing in computational biology and bioinformatics [journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K6nz3aoAAAAJ), as well as presenting in [workshops and conferences](talks.md).

Iâ€™m currently working on :
  - Developing novel fragmentation strategies in metabolomics via [ViMMS](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms/tree/master/vimms)
    and [ViMMS-gym](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms-gym).
  - Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design via [pyBasket](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pyBasket).
    
Other past projects that you may find interesting:
  - Discovering substructures in tandem mass spectrometry data using [MS2LDA](https://ms2lda.org) and [pySubstructures](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pySubstructures).
  - Omics data integration framework through [GraphOmics](https://graphomics.glasgowcompbio.org/) and [pyMultiOmics](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pyMultiOmics/).
