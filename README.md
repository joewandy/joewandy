### Hi 👋 I'm Joe.

I'm an ML engineer / data scientist at [Glasgow Polyomics](https://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

[![Joe's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=joewandy)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on :
  - Developing novel fragmentation strategies in metabolomics via [ViMMS](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms/tree/master/vimms)
    and [ViMMS-gym](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms-gym).
  - Discovering substructures in tandem mass spectrometry data using [MS2LDA](https://ms2lda.org) and [pySubstructures](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pySubstructures).
  - Omics data integration framework through [GraphOmics](https://graphomics.glasgowcompbio.org/) and [pyMultiOmics](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pyMultiOmics/).

- 📝 You can find my [list of publications here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K6nz3aoAAAAJ).

- 📈 Invited talks and presentations
  - [Mass spectrometry control in metabolomics using reinforcement learning](https://github.com/joewandy/joewandy/raw/main/presentations/MLIS_2022.pdf) -- poster presentation at [Machine Learning in Science Conference](https://mlisconf.org), University of Glasgow.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on omics data integration, metabolomics data analysis, and any other interesting project!
